The Hypothetical Tumblr is a place where you can log in and pose questions as well as answer them. All posts are public to other users and can be found in the friends list.

There are five main tags that color code what type of Hypothetical you ask. These are Relationships(red), Jobs(blue), WouldYouRather(green), Technology(grey), Impossible(yellow). The default color is turquoise.

You can also comment on someones post.

You can search for either a user or a main tag. Post MVP would be changing the tags to be a many to many table relationship with posts so that I can search for any tag not just the main one.

This project was created using Ruby with Sinatra as the framework and an Active Record database. This is deployed on Heroku as:
